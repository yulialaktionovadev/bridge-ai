# 🌉 Bridge AI: Making the complex simple

**Bridge AI** is a minimalist web application designed for busy parents and curious minds. It translates complex articles, scientific terms, or "adult" news into simple, age-appropriate explanations for children.

## ✨ The Problem
In an era of information overload, explaining complex topics (like "How does the stock market work?" or "Why is there a conflict in the news?") to a child can be daunting, especially when you are short on time.

## 🚀 The Solution
Bridge AI acts as a cognitive "adapter." Users can paste any complex content, select a target age, and choose a **Persona** to get a perfectly tailored explanation in seconds.

### 🎭 Key Features:
* **Persona-driven explanations:** Choose between a **Wise Owl** (metaphors), **Tech Bot** (logic), or **Kind Soul** (emotional support).
* **Adaptive Language:** AI adjusts its vocabulary based on the child's age (2 to 15 years old).
* **Minimalist UX:** Clean, distraction-free interface designed for one-handed mobile use.
* **PWA Ready:** Can be installed on a smartphone for quick access.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
* **AI Integration:** Vercel AI SDK + OpenAI GPT-4o-mini / Groq (Llama 3)
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## 🧠 The "Secret Sauce" (Prompt Engineering)
The core of this project is a dynamic System Prompt that handles persona switching and age-based content filtering. It ensures that the output is not just "simple," but safe and engaging for kids.

## 👩‍💻 Author's Note
This project was born out of a personal need. As a developer and a mother, I realized how much we need tools that bridge the gap between complex reality and a child's curiosity. 

Coding at the speed of a nap time. ☕✨
